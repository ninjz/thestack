Calvin's Bio

My name is Calvin Cheng. Born and raised in Toronto, I was interested in programming and computers
at a very young age, and first started building websites when I was in grade 5. In high school I took a turn for the
worst and went off path. Originally at UofT studying Life Sciences for three and a half semesters - I dropped out
for one semester, before coming back to specialize in computer science. My interest is in cloud computing,
network security and mobile development. I currently am working on mobile app projects on the side, and I also drive
for UberX on the side for some cash. My passion outside of school is Muay Thai, where I used to compete nationally with
my team Southside Muay Thai located in Scarborough. I also like to read, code, do crazy things and go out and party on the weekends :).
Upon graduating I hope to land a job at promising new startup; or be able to find some great minds to help put one together.
