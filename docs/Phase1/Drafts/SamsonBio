Samson's Bio

My name is Samson Chung and I am a third year computer science student at UofT. I was born in Richmond Hill, just North of Toronto but currently live around campus for school. I am a member of New Collegeâ€™s dragon boat team New Dragons and am currently their Finance Director. Being part of the team, I frequently go to the gym for fun and to run practices. I also like to play video games and hang out with friends. I enjoy computer science but am not sure what direction I want to go in within the field. I hope to learn more about software engineering through this class and help me decide my plans for the future!
