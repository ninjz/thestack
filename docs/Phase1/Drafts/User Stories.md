John Miller decides to search for a better website to practice computer science. John eventually finds The Stack. John decides to start a new beginner exercise in Python that he finds on The Stack.

John has to create a for loop that keeps track of the sum of 100 randomly generated integers and write it to a text file. All the code is provided for John but the lines are in a mixed up order. John carefully deciphers the code and does not need to find external resources to solve the problem.

John decides to learn more about algorithms and proofs and finds an exercise to re-stack a proof that is written and mixed up.

Jessie finds her exercises in CSC108 because she is not that familiar with computer science. Jessie uses The Stack to find the relevant topics to the concepts she is learning in her CSC108 class
Jessie decides to do some of the problems she finds. With the code provided, using The Stack, she is able to keep track of her progress and what concepts she has practiced.

Daniel is a gamer, so he would like an interactive way of learning instead of the traditional conventional way. Daniel does an activity on learning Python and immediately is interested in this game because of how it feels like it is a game with pop ups that give him “tips”.
Daniel is a competitive gamer. Each exercise has a leader board and Daniel practices each exercise thoroughly so he can get a better score.
Not only does Daniel want to do well at individual exercises, Daniel wants to climb the overall rankings for Python and eventually other languages too.
