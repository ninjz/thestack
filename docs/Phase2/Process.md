GitHub Use
Our work was mostly split into different teams within our group. The work was split so that there was generally not too much overlap. For the work within the group, a lot of the time, the smaller teams worked together in real life/on Skype and we did not have many synchronization issues. We used standard camelCase naming conventions and were descriptive in naming variables and functions.

Other Tools
The main tool we used outside of GitHub was Meteor. Meteor is an open source platform for building website and mobile app in pure JavaScript.

Decision Making
At first, we decided on Calvin as our scrum leader. He was in many ways our leader for the project - he organized the basis of our project and helped other team members on various aspects of the project. However, ultimately our scrum meetings were team-driven and we did not feel like we needed a leader to lead the meeting. We felt like it was the right decision to not have a specific scrum leader because we always had things to discuss without needing a leader to guide the conversation.
