What’s The Stack:

The Stack is a web based educational tool designed for interactively teaching the basics of writing code. Through its interactive tutorial style method in the form of a stacking game, The Stack, caters to computer­ science students of beginner to novice levels as well as non-computer science students who wish to learn the basics of coding. The game teaches syntax and structure of coding through a game. The game provides users a problem and the lines of the code that form an algorithm which is the solution to the problem - however the lines of code are not in order. The user must then 'stack' the lines of code in the correct order to solve the problem. This process makes sure users can comprehend and analyze each line of code without making them write code from scratch.

What we built in Phase 2:

* Login function
* Register account function
* Domain Page
* Game: Basic prototype of one example problem which includes
        - Drag and drop method using the mouse
        - Uses a grid board that provides better visualization for indentation
        - Game pieces snap to board
        - Dynamic code that allows for problems of any size to be used (not in use for our example)
